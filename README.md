# Advanced Styling Techniques

## About the setup

This project is set up with [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/), an npm package
that compiles our frontend assets and comes with an integrated development server.

The dev server runs on port `1234` by default, but will use another if `1234` is
being used by another application.

## Running this project

- Clone the repo.
- Navigate into the project folder.
- Run `npm i` to download the project's dependencies listed in the `package.json`.
- Run `npm start` to compile the React project and serve the page on `http://localhost:1234`.

### Notes:
Rules for styled components:
1) Styled components are built outside of the component they serve

2) Styled Components have to be capitalized

3) Do NOT forget semicolons!



#### Sprint Notes:
Be able to do:
- use React
   - imports for react
   - pass props into a component
      - destructuring props
   - create new slice of state
   - know how to use useEffect
 - Know how to map over data
   - axios
- have at least one style components
   - import styled
   - can do a theme js, but don't have to (I think)
